# alphatype
This is a Python program I made for a fun project.

It takes a string and draws it using Turtle.

Only alpha characters are supported, and in uppercase only.

To use it, simply run it, and enter a value to draw on the canvas. It must support the criteria above. As long as the `turtle` module is available, your string will be drawn out onto the canvas.

To customize the turtle, edit `alphatype.py` and look at the configuration options (e.g. `pen_speed` or `pen_color`).

Each character is drawn using commands I made entirely manually.
