# alphatype
This is a Python program I made for a fun project.

It takes a string and draws it using Turtle.

Only alpha characters are supported, and in uppercase only.

To use it, edit `alphatype.py` and change the `draw_words` value to whatever string you desire, as long as it fits the criteria above.

Have a look at the other options in there as well. 

Then, simply run it, and as long as the `turtle` module is available, your string will be drawn out onto the canvas.

Each character is drawn using commands I made entirely manually.
